# Amazon Review Topic Modeling 
Similar to the online chatter of social media, the reviews from E-commerce giant also provides abundant information to explore. Whether in the upgrade of product quality given the customer's comment, or provide sophisticated targeting market strategy, the natural language processing would be of great help in this course. <br>

In this project, the goal is to find the topic pattern of the reviews, and provide business insights with the result. <br>

Specifically, I built an _*text ETL pipeline*_ that tokenize, lemmatize, removing stop words over 20k Amazon review text data, then using TF-IDF for feature extraction. Then I deployed _*unsupervised learning*_ models of K-Means and Latent Dirichlet Analysis, conduct hyperparameter for optimal number of documents, visualize the LDA clustering result, using coherence score for model evaluation, and finally deliver the business insight.
